Description: Given a BAM alignment file, each read pair will have two edges.
    edgeCounter counts the number of read pair edges that overlaps within
    a set of genomic ranges. To assist with constructing/importing genomic 
    ranges, edgeCounter provides minimal dependency, easy-to-use functions for
    importing genomic ranges from existing BED or BED-like files (e.g., MACS2 
    narrowPeak) and constructing genomic ranges by manually inputting specific 
    ranges. While a complete vignette showing ATAC sequencing quantification is 
    included, edgeCounter is expected to be directly applicable to other 
    sequencing applications where alignment edges/ends, rather than full-length 
    alignments themselves, are of interest.
