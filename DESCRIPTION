Description: Given a BAM alignment file, each read pair will have two edges/ends.
    Given a 'GRanges' object, this package counts number of read pair edges that overlaps within
    each range of the 'GRanges'. The resulting counts could be used for downstream differential analysis
    such as 'DESeq2'.
    Useful for certain genomic sequencing applications, e.g., ATAC-seq.
